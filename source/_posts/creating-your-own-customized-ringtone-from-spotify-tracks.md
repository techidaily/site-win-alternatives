## Creating Your Own Customized Ringtone From Spotify Tracks

### Overview

For many mobile users, especially the young ones, they do not like to share the same ringtones with users who have the same brand mobiles. They want to have a unique phone ringtone to show their inner selves, their personality. To find a unique ringtone, these users like to visit some music service to download their favorite music as their phone ringtone. For these users, Spotify is one of their frequently visited music service.

However, another problem comes, that is, Spotify does not allow free users to download Spotify music and it only allows its subscribed users to download Spotify music for offline playback within Spotify App. It brings much inconvenience, because in most cases, users need to import the downloaded Spotify music to some audio editing program to cut their needed ringtone out. Is there an easy method to make ringtone from Spotify? Of course, there is and the following just describes this easy method.
